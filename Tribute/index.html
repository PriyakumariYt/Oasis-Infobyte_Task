          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami
            bibekanɔndo] (listen); 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born
            Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian
            Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief
            disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure
            in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western
            world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness,
            and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.
            Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta,
            Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and
            spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a
            monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured
            the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the
            living conditions of Indian people in then British India.
